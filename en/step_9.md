## Scare a grandpa

Attach your box above an unsuspecting grandpa (or other family member or friend), using a secure method.

### Warning!!

**Please get an adult to attach the box, and only use it when they are completely confident it won't fall.**

If hanging the box using string, please make use of the four holes on the outer corners of the box to create a cradle of string to hang it from.

Above all though, be careful, as a wooden box falling on someone's head could cause serious harm!
