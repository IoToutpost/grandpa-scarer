## What next?

Other things to try:

- There is a hole in the design for a status LED. Why not try and get that flashing when the box is primed and ready to drop?
- Could you make it wireless? Instead of a big red button with a long cable, why not attach a USB WiFi adaptor and control it from another computer, or even better, your smartphone?
