 By creating a Grandpa Scarer you will learn:
 
 - How to build a wooden box to specification using a laser cutter
 - How to use a servo to control a motor
 - How to use Python to control GPIO input and output devices
 - How to use Python functions to group commands together for a particular purpose
 - How to use PyGame to play sounds in Python
 - How PWM (pulse-width modulation) signals are used to control servos to slow down motors

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)
- [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/builder)
- [Independently use fabrication systems to produce complex finished projects](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/manufacture/maker)
